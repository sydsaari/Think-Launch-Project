After the install fest in our first class session, I didn't do much until the email was sent out.
I first did the tutorial for how to use the command line, refreshing my memory about how to operate the command line and the different commands that it uses.
After going through the tutorial and taking the quiz, I moved onto the next step.
I already had github and an account, so I went through the tutorial, refreshing my memory again of what we learned in class, getting some more practice.
I then completed the markdown tutorial.
Then I went to my designated project folder and edited my README and installfest documents.
I didn't encounter many problems, but I do feel that it will take me several times of going through this process in order to fully get this process down where I am not super confused and questioning every step I have to take all the time.
