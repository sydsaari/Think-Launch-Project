1. _What is the problem you're trying to solve?_
  The problem that I am trying to solve is the promotion of local creatives (artists, writers, musicians, digital design, etc) that are just starting and are trying to promote/sell their work.
2. _How might we...?_
  How might I try and promote local creatives/new artists and allow them to spread their work? Gain some profit in the process? Not have their work stolen?
3. _What is the impact you're trying to have?_
  Growing the local artist/creative community presence and allowing the spread of their artwork/ideas/events. I want to make it a bit easier for small and struggling artists to promote themselves and grow as an artist with support from their local community.
4. _Possible solutions?_
  - A website that has/allows multiple media forms for different types of art/creative works.
  - An app that would allow artists to share/promote their newest artworks/events/shows. It would send push notifications and possibly allow for mobile posting.
  - An unknown platform that allows me to do share events, artists work, and allows promotion of artists/events
5. _Context/Constraints you're facing?_
  - Relies on artists/creatives cooperation with sharing their art/events/shows in order to keep it up to date and accurate
  - Will only start off local in Chicago. If it grows and spreads to other cities, need to make a separation
  - How to make it beneficial to artists in order to create revenue/sell their work?
  - How to protect their work from being stolen/copied/plagiarized?
  - How to make users feel safe to share their work?
  - How to promote/share local artist events/shows/work?
  - How to encourage local artist involvement?
  - It is hard to promote/sell local art nowadays
